  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "FiboBlink generates mathematical sequences through precisely timed LED patterns. Watch Fibonacci numbers come alive as LED pulses with intervals of 1,1,2,3,5,8,13... seconds. Also supports prime number sequences and perfect squares. Features configurable sequence selection and speed control for educational demonstrations and mathematical visualization."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     10000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (10 MHz for precise timing)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_fibo_blink"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
